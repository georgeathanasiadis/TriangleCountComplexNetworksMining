This project includesÂ numerous exact and approximate triangle counting algorithms in Python and investigates their scalability qualities on various real-world data sets obtained from SNAP.
The Brute-Force, Node-Iterator, and Compact-Forward algorithms have been developed, while the DOULION method is employed for approximate triangle counting. Additionally, the streaming algorithm TRIEST is investigated for triangle counting in dynamic graphs.
The studies assess each algorithm's effectiveness on various data sets and compare efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
Our findings give a detailed review of each technique and its scalability qualities, which will be useful for academics and practitioners working with huge networks and seeking fast triangle counting algorithms.

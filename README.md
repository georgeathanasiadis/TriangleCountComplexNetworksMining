# count-triangles-in-networks

This project implements several __exact__ and __approximate__ __triangle counting algorithms__ using __Python__ and explores their __scalability properties__ on different real-world data sets, retrieved from __SNAP__.  
The implemented exact algorithms include the **Brute-Force** algorithm, the **Node-Iterator** algorithm, and the **Compact-Forward** algorithm, while the **DOULION** algorithm is used for approximate triangle counting. Additionally, the streaming algorithm **TRIEST** is explored for triangle counting in dynamic graphs.  
The experiments evaluate the performance of each algorithm on different data sets and compare their efficiency in terms of __time and space complexity__.  
The results of our study provide a comprehensive evaluation of each algorithm and its scalability properties, which will be valuable for researchers and practitioners who work with large graphs and are interested in efficient triangle counting algorithms.  
  
*In the notebook, one can find basic theory, besides code.
